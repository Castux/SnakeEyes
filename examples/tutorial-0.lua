-- To use this tool, you write little programs in the Lua programming language. If you don't know it, don't worry, it's super simple! Just by following the tutorials you should be able to grasp enough to get by. To learn the language more thoroughly, you can read "Programming in Lua" (https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) and then move on to the Lua reference manual (https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/)

-- You might have noticed that in Lua, lines that start with "--" are ignored as comments.

-- Here is a tiny program that isn't very useful:

print "Hello world!"

-- Click the "Run" button to see the results. You can also use the shortcut control-enter. All the tutorials will be in this format: comments in valid programs. Don't hesitate to modify them to try things out!

-- Finally, note that your work will always be saved in your browser's local storage, so you can safely close the tab and come back later, your last program will still be there!

-- However, you might want to save your interesting programs to your own files. Or you could use the "Share" button, which will encode your entire program in a URL, that you can post on forums or bookmark for yourself.
