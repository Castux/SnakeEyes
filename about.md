## Why {{ site.title }}?

{{ site.title }} is a web-based calculator for dice probabilities. It was inspired by [AnyDice](https://anydice.com/) and [Troll](https://topps.diku.dk/torbenm/troll.msp). I wanted a similar tool, but whose user-facing language would be Lua, as that is most likely my favorite programming language. I wrote the Dice library and used it for myself for a long time before deciding to bring it to an online tool.

It was also a fun little project for me to practice web technologies, and small enough to reach a satisfying state of completeness.
